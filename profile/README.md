## 🌐 OpenAGI.Network 

OpenAGI.Network is an independent research & development group within **"OpenCyberspace.org"** that works on the **open, fastest, safest,** and **most efficient path to Artificial General Intelligence** — the *Open Web of Intelligence* and the *Open Web of Agents*.  

At OpenAGI.Network, we strictly engineer at every step for **planetary scale** and **production-grade performance**.

We believe the **Open Intelligence Web** is a key transitional step towards **open & decentralized AGI**, especially if you define AGI not just as a single monolithic super-intelligence, but as an **emergent property of distributed & interconnected intelligence systems that cooperate in a decentralized manner**.
